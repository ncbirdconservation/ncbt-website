<p>The Rachel Carson Reserve is located between the mouths of the Newport and North Rivers in southern Carteret County, directly across Taylor's Creek from the historic town of Beaufort. This site is a complex of islands: Carrot Island, Town Marsh, Bird Shoal, and Horse Island. These islands are more than three miles long and less than a mile wide. Middle Marsh, separated from the rest of the site by the North River Channel, is almost two miles long and less than a mile wide. The entire Rachel Carson component is 2,315 acres. More than 200 species of birds have been observed at the site, which is adjacent to the Atlantic Flyway. The site is an important feeding area for Wilson&rsquo;s plovers in the summer and piping plovers in the winter.</p>
<p>Two mile-long interpretive nature trails are located on Town Marsh directly across Taylor&rsquo;s Creek from the N.C. Maritime Museum&rsquo;s Watercraft Center.&nbsp; The outer loop trail is best accessed at low tide.&nbsp; On the south side of the trails between Town Marsh and Bird Shoal, a wide variety of shorebirds often can be seen probing the mud, including Ruddy Turnstone, Willet, Short-billed Dowitcher and Sanderling. In the fall it is possible to see hundreds of Black Skimmer at Bird Shoal and Horse Island.&nbsp; On Carrot Island, visitors can enjoy birding from the boardwalk at low tide when mudflats are visible.</p>
<p>The Rachel Carson Reserve is one of 10 sites that make up the North Carolina Coastal Reserve &amp; National Estuarine Research Reserve. Preservation of the Rachel Carson Reserve allows this coastal ecosystem to be available as a natural outdoor laboratory where scientists, students and the general public can learn about coastal processes, functions and inï¬‚uences that shape and sustain the coastal area.</p>

<h1>Special Features/Concerns</h1>
<p>Hunting is allowed within certain areas of the reserve during parts of the year. Birders should be aware of current hunting regulations and seasons and take adequate safety precautions during those times. For more on hunting season safety precautions, see the hunting season information at the beginning of this guide. Footwear should completely cover the foot as shells, especially oyster shells, are very sharp and can cut easily. Feral horses inhabit the islands and can be unpredictable and even aggressive if approached by visitors.&nbsp; It is unlawful to approach the horses within 50 feet (size of a large bus), but it is recommended that visitors stay much further away than 50 feet.&nbsp; Visitors can safely experience the horses&rsquo; natural behaviors best at greater distances.&nbsp; Special habitat areas, such as the horses' watering holes and the shorebird nesting sites, are off limits to visitors.</p>
