The park was previously used by the state Department of Transportation to mine sand that was used in the construction of Interstate 40. The sand mining created a basin that filled with water from a spring, forming a lake that covers about 47 acres. Water in the basin was acidic and required applications of lime to make the pH level suitable for fish. In 2008, local Boy Scouts bundled old Christmas trees that were sunk into the lake to provide habitats for fish. In October 2009, the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission stocked fish in the lake, the first in a multi-stage project that should provide fish big enough to catch in about two years. One section of the western edge of the park, near Interstate 40, will remain undeveloped for now, but could provide space for additional walking trails in the future. Adjacent to the 92-acres of Smith Creek Park, New Hanover County Parks Department recently purchased additional 87-acres to be added to Smith Creek Park with plans for future improvements. Altogether, the site is 179 acres of continuous park land adjacent to Smith Creek, which is a watershed that connects to the Cape Fear River. A Greenway is being planned along the length of Smith Creek, and this site of Smith Creek Park is a major component of a larger wildlife and recreational corridor."~"Blue grosbeak (summer), red-headed woodpecker (year-round), osprey (summer), brown headed nuthatch (year round), bald eagle (occasional fly overs), eastern bluebird (year-round), pileated woodpecker (year-round), waterfowl: more birding data needed, but a sizable site with quality habitat."~"dry coniferous woodlands, oak forest & mixed hardwood/pine, early successional, lakes and reservoirs, dry longleaf pine, pocosin, wet pine savanna, small wetland communities "~"Bird watching opportunities prevail year-round.

Listen for all three nuthatch species hanging out with the chickadees and titmice. The Mayo River itself hosts a bounty of birds in every season.  In the breeding season look and listen for Northern Parula and Louisiana Waterthrush and stay alert for the rattle of a Belted Kingfisher.  Black Vulture, Common Raven, Broad-winged Hawk and other raptors may be seen soaring overhead and breed in the area.  Early in the season Wood Ducks can be seen entering cavities and later toting their young around for a family swim.
