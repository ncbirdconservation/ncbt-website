<h2>Who we are</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>From our vast coastline to our high mountain peaks, North Carolina is home to a diversity of habitats that support hundreds of species of birds and other wildlife.  Our unique geographic setting along the Atlantic coast flyway provides both breeding and wintering grounds for many birds, making North Carolina a premiere birding destination.  Yet this rich natural heritage is largely untapped as an economic resource for promoting nature-based tourism. The North Carolina Birding Trail (NCBT) will establish North Carolina as a leading nature-based tourism destination.</p>  

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>The NCBT is a partnership between six founding organizations:the <a href="http://www.ncwildlife.org" target="_blank">NC Wildlife Resources Commission</a>, <a href="http://www.ncaudubon.org/" target="_blank">Audubon North Carolina</a>, <a href="http://www.ncseagrant.org/" target="_blank">North Carolina Sea Grant</a>, <a href="http://www.fws.gov/northcarolina/" target="_blank">US Fish & Wildlife Service</a>, <a href="http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">NC State University Cooperative Extension</a>,and the <a href="http://ncparks.gov/" target="_blank">NC Parks and Recreation</a>.</p>

<p>The NCBT is governed by a steering committee which includes one member from each of the six founding organizations.  

<p>We are currently re-evaluating as an organization and will soon release our new Strategic Plan (<a href="/storage/files/NCBT_StrategicPlan.pdf">the current plan can be accessed here</a>).</p>
