<p>The 180-acre site is located in a forested track of land along the French Broad River.  The hilly site includes a small vernal pond at the far northern edge as well as a small stream cloaked in hardwood forest.  There are several good sites in the park to view birds.  The North Carolina Natural Heritage Program surveyed the site and delineated 5 vegetation zones; floodplain/ pool, chestnut oak bluff, cover forest, montane alluvial forest, and montane oak/hickory forest.  The trail network traverses all of these zones.  The northern end of the park is bordered by the French Broad River, although a railroad trestle limits access to the riverbank.  A trail map is in the works, but has not yet been complete.</p>

<h1>Special Features/Concerns</h1>
<p>There have been some rare species found in the park including the Southern Nodding Trillium (T. rugelii), the Southern Zigzag Salamander (P. ventralis), the Spotted Salamander (A. maculatum), and the marbled Salamander (A. opacum). Interestingly there are several small red spruce (Picea rubens) trees growing at the site.  Also identified from the site is Eubranchipus holmanii, the eastern fairy shrimp and it appears that this is the only record of the species in the state.  Use of the trails is not expected to disturb the pools where the shrimp resides, although the pools are visible from the trail network.  Some of the park is used for disc golf in areas closer to the parking lot, and some of the trails are used by mountain bikers, joggers, dog walkers as well as bird watches. The site is accessible via a paved road with a formalized parking lot.  Insects associated with forests and wetlands should be expected and poison ivy is present along the trail in some locations.</p>
